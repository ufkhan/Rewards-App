# Rewards-App
Charter Coding Assignment - Rewards App

This is my implementation of the Charter Coding Assignment. 
Functionality:
- Created application using the MERN Stack
- Implemented simple backend using Express, Nodejs, and Javascript.
- Created a cloud MongoDB database, and 2 data models, one for User and the other for each Record and used mongoose to connect application to database
- Utilized JWT Tokens and Bcrypt library for authentication and security
- Created API endpoints, utilizing GET and POST requests and used Postman to test
- Designed and implemented front end in Javascript, React, and CSS for minor styling
- Utilized Hooks like useEffect and useState
- Wrote asynchronous API calls to call backend APIs using both ES2015 syntax (async await) as well as .then promise syntax
- Created User Login and Register pages, so each user only sees their own data
- Stored JWT server token on user local browser and used to fet user specific data
- Displayed each purchase along with rewards earned for that purchase, along with a total rewards points count for each customer
- Option to 'Make a purchase' and add to MongoDB database, and display new value on UI for each specific user
- NOTE: Not alot of error handling implemented due to time constraints
- Sample Login Info Already Implemented (Feel free to login in with these credentials to test Login functionality, but also make your own account from the register page!)
